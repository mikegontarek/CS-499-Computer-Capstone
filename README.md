# CS-499-Computer-Capstone files
## Files for Java project

For this class I used my Contact and ContactService class from my https://github.com/mikegontarek/CS-320-Software-Test-and-Automation Software-Test-and-Automation class.  I have two sets of files to show the code before and after my enhancements.  The before files are the "Original" and the after enhancments are the name of the class with out original. 

## SQL files

For this class I used Live SQL to creat my SQL statements that created and enhanced my tables.  I had to recreate my original code from word documents as my work was unable to be retrieved as I took the class over two years prior and was then locked out from Codio class.
